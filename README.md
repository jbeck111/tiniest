# tiniest
Tiniest clojure apps

These apps in folders are intended to show the minimal way of doing a thing successfully in Clojure.

All extraneous stuff (tests, folders) is ruthlessly pruned away so that there is no distraction from the core concept.

That is, except for a couple of essentials.
- a project.clj to show how the dependencies are specified  
- a readme
