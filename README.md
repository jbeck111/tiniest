# tiniest
Tiniest clojure apps

These apps in folders are intended to show the minimal way of doing a thing successfully in Clojure.

All extraneous stuff (tests, folders) is prohibited, and ruthlessly pruned away so that there is no distraction from the core concept.

But atually they are the smallest "lein-based" demonstration of a thing that will return a result to your screen.  There is a project.clj.  And a readme.
