# tiniest
### Tiniest clojure apps

These little apps are intended to show the minimal way of doing a thing successfully in Clojure.

All extraneous stuff (tests, folders) is ruthlessly pruned away so that there is no distraction from the core concept.

Each has a project.clj to show how the dependencies are specified.  See also the readme for each app.
