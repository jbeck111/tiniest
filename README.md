### Tiniest clojure apps

These little apps are some notes that I made while learning Clojure.  

They are an exploration of the minimal way of doing a thing successfully.  

All extraneous stuff (tests, folders) is pruned away so that there is no distraction from the core concept.  

Each app has a project.clj to show how the dependencies are specified.
