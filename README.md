# tiniest
Tiniest clojure apps

These apps in folders are intended to show the minimal way of doing a thing successfully in Clojure.

All extraneous stuff (tests, folders) is ruthlessly pruned away so that there is no distraction from the core concept.

That is, except for a small number of essentials. There is 
- a project.clj so that it will work from lein (this is also needed to show how the dependencies are specified)  
- a readme  
- and the code will generate some result (eg a line on your screen) to show that it worked, when you run it.
