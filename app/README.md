# app

The very minimum boilerplate for a clojure app to work with "lein run"

## Origins

This is what you get if you do "lein new app app"
(make a new app using lein's app template)

...and then prune out everything that can be pruned out

until lein refuses to run the app if you prune any further.

## Usage

In the project folder, enter the command
"lein run"
